This is a project that introduced me to Django thanks to Programming with Mosh. I learned the fundementals of how Django works as well as learning about Bootstrap and the different designs for HTML, such as how to make a card and a navigation bar. This project is an online grocery store that has a products page where you can view all the items and their prices but also a admin side where there is a certain login to access. The admin page allows you to create new products as well as create new discount codes.
